alternate speeds.

On Tuesdays and Fridays at 2230 UTC (6:30 PM EDT), Keplerian
Elements for active amateur satellites are sent on the regular
digital frequencies.

A DX bulletin replaces or is added to the regular bulletins between
0000 UTC (8 PM EDT) Thursdays and 0000 UTC (8 PM EDT) Fridays.

Audio from W1AW's CW code practices, and CW/digital/phone bulletins
is available using EchoLink via the W1AW Conference Server named
"W1AWBDCT."  The monthly W1AW Qualifying Runs are presented here as
well.  The CW/digital/phone audio is sent in real-time and runs
concurrently with W1AW's regular transmission schedule.

All users who connect to the conference server are muted.  Please
note that any questions or comments about this server should not be
sent via the "Text" window in EchoLink. Please direct any questions
or comments to w1aw@arrl.org .

In a communications emergency, monitor W1AW for special bulletins as
follows: Voice on the hour, Digital at 15 minutes past the hour, and
CW on the half hour.

FCC licensed amateurs may operate the station from 1400 UTC to 1945
UTC (10 AM to 3:45 PM EDT) Monday through Friday.  Be sure to bring
a reference copy of your current FCC amateur radio license.

The weekly W1AW and monthly West Coast Qualifying Runs are sent on
the normal CW frequencies used for both code practice and bulletin
transmissions.  West Coast Qualifying Run stations may also use 3590
kHz.

Please note a W1AW Qualifying Run replaces a regularly scheduled
code practice transmission on any particular day and time.
